# Rotary Snowball Sweepstakes
The front end of this website was built using react. I am showcasing only the front end with some modifications in a public repository in order to preserve the site's security. The live version of the site is still being improved, but I won't be updating this showcase so any bugs that I fix will remain here for posterity :)

The website was built with ease of use in mind. Almost everything on the site is customizable by admins through the front end interface.

We wanted users to have a simple experience too. Pages are designed in a minimal way with clear instructions, to avoid confusing or misleading users that are less familiar with technology.

The Rotary Snowball Sweepstakes website is nearing the end of its development. As soon as it's live, this README will be updated with a link to the site so you can explore it yourself!

**note** All sponsor logos in these demonstration gifs are just placeholders, these companies (if they exist) are not affiliated with the Rotary Snowball Sweepstakes in any way.
